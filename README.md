# leaflet-challenge

Hi,

this is my submission for the Module 15 Challenge. 
In the repository you will find index.html file and static folder with 2 subfolders: js and css. In the CSS folder you will find modified css file. 
The final logic.js can be found in js subfolder.

As per Teacher's instruction a popup with additional information about the earthquake is triggered by a click (as opposed to hoovering over the marker)

Thanks,

Katharina
